### Tools & Methods
For this project Google Colab has been used for customized model training.   
For Data pre-processing (converting into yolo label) labelImg has been used. Download Link -------> (https://sourceforge.net/projects/labelimg.mirror/)


### Process
Implemention process of the system can be divided into following sections
  * Collection of Dataset (Images)
  * Pre-Processing on Collected Data (In Yolo format)
  * Installing Darknet prerequisites
  * Train Customize Yolov4 model
  * Testing of trained model on Images and Video
